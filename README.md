# Information-Retrieval-Edit-Distance

Welcome to the **Information-Retrieval-Edit-Distance** repository! This repository contains various implementations of edit distance algorithms, which are fundamental in the field of information retrieval and string comparison.

## Overview

Edit distance algorithms are used to measure the similarity between two strings by calculating the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another. These operations typically include insertions, deletions, and substitutions. This repository includes implementations of different edit distance methods, suitable for various applications in text processing, natural language processing, and computational biology.

## Contents

The repository contains the following edit distance algorithms:

- **Levenshtein Distance**: Measures the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one word into the other.
- **Damerau-Levenshtein Distance**: An extension of Levenshtein distance that includes transpositions of two adjacent characters as an edit operation.
- **Hamming Distance**: Measures the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols of two equal-length strings are different.
- **Jaro-Winkler Distance**: A string metric measuring an edit distance between two sequences with a focus on the beginning of the strings.
- **Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm**: A dynamic programming algorithm for sequence alignment.
- **Smith-Waterman Algorithm**: Performs local sequence alignment; good for finding similar regions in two sequences.

## Getting Started

To get started with using these algorithms, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarakhosrozadeh/Information-retrieval-edit-distance.git
```

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file with example usage provided in the comments. You can run these scripts directly to see the algorithms in action or integrate them into your own projects.


## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have an implementation of an edit distance algorithm not covered here or improvements to the existing code, feel free to submit a pull request. For more projects and updates, visit [Sara Khosrozadeh's GitHub page](https://github.com/sarakhosrozadeh).
